[4, 2, 11, 8, 5, 84]

1. (Count = 4) Answer choices are repeated or duplicated
    -Only choose this if there is an answer choice which appears 2 or more times in the answer choices explicitly
2. (Count = 2) The answer choices do not align with the implied format or level of detail suggested by the question
    -Example: Name 3 factors which contributed to increased immigration. --> Answer choices (1. Single Factor, 2. Single Factor, 3. Single Factor, 4. Single Factor)
        -Reasoning: The question asked for 3 factors, but the answer choices only gave one each.
    -Only choose this category if there is an explicit format expected in the answer choices, and if this format is explicitly not met
3. (Count = 11) The question asks about details on a particular subject, but the marked correct answer is simply the subject itself
    -Only choose this category if the question asks for details about a subject, but the correct answer is simply the subject itself
    -Example: Question: What is empathic reflection, and how is it applied in therapy?
                Answer Choices: 
                Empathic confrontation
                Cognitive restructuring 
                Behavioral activation 
                Empathic reflection
4. (Count = 8) No correct answer choice is provided among the options
    -Only choose this answer if given the context, none of the provided choices answer the question correctly
    -Check thorugh all of the context to detirmine the right answer explicity to ensure that there truly is no correct answer given
5. (Count = 5) The question answer is excessively obvious due to format 
    -Only choose this if and only if the correct answer is made excessively clear due to either the phrasing of question or its answers. 
    -Example:  Question: What is the self-discrepancy theory proposed by Tory Higgins?
                Answer Choices: 
                Self-verification theory: people want to be known according to their self-views
                Cognitive dissonance theory: discomfort from conflicting beliefs or attitudes
                Self-perception theory: inferring attitudes from behavior and context
                Self-discrepancy theory: beliefs about actual, ideal, and ought selves
            This is incorrect because the phrasing of the answer choices itself makes the correct answer excessivly obvious

                The availability of hospital amenities

                The technical quality of treatment, the quality of interaction with practitioner, a sense of autonomy (correct one)
